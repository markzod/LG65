  <div class="section"><span class="label">Lunch:</span> 12:30 packed lunch:</div>
  <div class="section"><span class="label">Afternoon:</span> There are many places to stop  and do a short hikes along the way.   Trailheads (we'll get a map from the bike stores): - Rainforest Trails (most well known)  -Combers Beach Trail (500 M 1 way) - some steel slopes, thru forests, to Ocean -Halfmoon Bay tral 3.6 km RT, moderate, steep sections, steps, boardwalk, to beach -Nuu-chah-nulth Trail (5 km RT), moderate- ends at Florencia Bay Beach North  -Rainforest Trail A: 1 km loop, stairs and steps, thru temperate rainforest, gigantic w red cedar and w hemlocks -Rainforest Trail B: 1 km loop boardwalk, steops, ravines, same description  - South Beach Trail: 1.6km RT, some steep, steps, stairs, South Beach offers spectacular, but potentially dangerous, wave watching. Very large waves and strong currents form at this pebble beach. Water activities are not recommended. When the weather and waves are less dramatic, it is a popular beach to listen to the sound of water washing over the stones.  - Shorepine Bog Trail: 800 m loop, boardwalk, uneven: You can experience an old growth coastal temperate rainforest with a twist. Often referred to as the “broccoli forest”, the trees are small, the soil damp and one can almost imagine being in a Dr. Seuss storybook.  Bogs are characterized by poor drainage, acidic soils, and a thick build-up of Sphagnum moss. The soil in a bog provides little food for its inhabitants hence their small stature. The small size of these trees may hide many years of survival.  - Radar Hill Trail: 1 km Rt, steep -   Radar Hill was the site of a radar station during World War II. This short trail takes you past the Kapyong memorial which commemorates the battle of Kapyong in the Korean War. It then takes you further up to a viewing platform that has the highest vantage point in the Long Beach Unit.  - Ucluelet Lighthouse Trail  -  (hike loop), Ucluelet,   https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/visit/visit5/visit8at 40.3 km, Uclulet;    https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/activ/randonnee-hiking</div>

  <div class="section"><span class="label">Lodging:</span> <a href="lodging8.html">All day with Bikes along theʔapsčiik t̓ašii (pronounced ups-cheek ta-shee)*  :          Weather may change at any time. Check the forecast and bring appropriate clothing/gear.   *  ʔapsčiik t̓ašii (pronounced ups-cheek ta-shee) is the new multi-use pathway, located in the ḥaḥuułi — the traditional territories and homelands — of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation and Yuułuʔiłʔatḥ. It extends approximately 25 km from the southern to the northern boundary of the Long Beach Unit of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. The pathway is paved along its entirety and provides access to numerous points of interest found in the national park reserve. Although the pathway is fairly flat, there are a few short, steep hills and curves along the way.  see some YouTubes: creating the path, planning it, human-wildlife coexistance, and An adaptive approach  https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/activ/piste-pathway</a></div>
