  <title>All day with Bikes along theʔapsčiik t̓ašii (pronounced ups-cheek ta-shee)*  :          Weather may change at any time. Check the forecast and bring appropriate clothing/gear.   *  ʔapsčiik t̓ašii (pronounced ups-cheek ta-shee) is the new multi-use pathway, located in the ḥaḥuułi — the traditional territories and homelands — of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation and Yuułuʔiłʔatḥ. It extends approximately 25 km from the southern to the northern boundary of the Long Beach Unit of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. The pathway is paved along its entirety and provides access to numerous points of interest found in the national park reserve. Although the pathway is fairly flat, there are a few short, steep hills and curves along the way.  see some YouTubes: creating the path, planning it, human-wildlife coexistance, and An adaptive approach  https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/activ/piste-pathway</title>
